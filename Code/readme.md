###############    WHICH FILE TO MODIFY?   ###############

Here you will find three files, all interconnected. 
To build the dashboard, you only need to modify the Example Dashboard file, 
but you must store the other two files in a way that allows you to recall them 
when creating the dashboard.

file to build the dashboard:

  -Example_dashboard_code.py

file to recall: 
  -Template_interfaccia.html
  -interfaccia.py
