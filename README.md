# interfaccia
A dashboard built in Python using a static HTML template, designed to simulate interactivity. 

This repository is designed to streamline the process of creating a modular, multi-device 
dashboard with simulated interactivity while minimizing Python code. 
It features functions that automate the creation of charts and tables, and it provides 
automatic download links for CSV files, allowing users to download data without the need
for server storage. Additionally, it addresses the issue of resizing Plotly charts when 
display is set to none.

# TO DO 

 - Improve the functionality for charts in "atomatic" function.
   
 - Integrate the automation of the "display": "block" declaration for the first content in
   each "page_menu", with the rest set to "display": "none", iterating this for every "page_menu"
   created. Integrate these features into the "dashboard" function.
    
 - Integrate additional page models into the template.
